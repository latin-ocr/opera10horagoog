12. Domus Albunea.» resonantis .- various have been the conjec-
mrcs 33 to the meaning of these wordS. There was at Tibur,
now Tt'voli, a wood, and near it a small lake or fountain‚ each called
Albunea, from a Sibyl of that name, whose temple still remains al-

· most entire on the rock which causes and overhangs the first and

priucipal falls of the Anio at Tivoli. Some commentatore suppose
the poet speaks of the country—seat of Plancus near this spot, and
somethat 113 refers to a deep cavern in the rock just below the
suns, into which the waters rush with a great noise; while others
understand him to mean the temple of the Sibyl, who in her re-
sponses is represented asreechoing the roar of the waterfalls. This
temple is certainly a most interesting tuin, and it forms at the pres-
ent day one of the most strikingly pictur-esque objects in this scene
of unrivalled beauty.

father, and went to Cyprus, where. he built another Salamis, The
poet here reminds Plancus, that Teucer did not allow himself to
be ’depressed‚ although banished from his home and country 3 and
that he, therefore, should call some of his friends about him, and

τθὲἓίυ his elasticity of spirit.

ODE VII.

In this ode, addressed to Lydia, a female of great beauty‚ but of· ’
worthless character, Horace draws the picture of a youth who 1133
become the victim of a deep and destructive passion.

2. Sybarin . . . perdere .- ‘ why are you hastening to destroy Sy-
baris by cherishing his guilty passion?’

S baris, a youth of fortune 31111 of ingenuous character, having
yielged to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his manly
exercises and 1113 former compamons, and was hastening to 113-
struction by that fatal infatuation which has led more youths to
perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices. '
