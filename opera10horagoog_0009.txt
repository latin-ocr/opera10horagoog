⁵ THE LIFE oF HoRAcE.

Qum-rus Hom'rms Fucens was born at Venusium in Apulia,
sixty-four years before Christ. His father was a freedman, and
collector of th'e revenue3 and gave his son a liberal education at
Rome and Athens. Aster enjoying the best means of in-
struction that Rome afforded, at the age of about twenty-one, Hor-
ace was sent to Athens to complete hiseducation. Whilst Horace
was at Athens, Caesar was assassinated 3 and Brutus and Cassius
repaired to that city, in order to enlist in the cause of freedom the
yo Romans who were pursuing their studies there. Horace
attac ed himself to Brutus, under whom he served nearly two
years. He was in the battle of Philippi, with the rank of military
tribune. He fied in the rout of that day, and was taken risoner3
but obtained a pardon, and afterwards was distinguishe by the
favor and friendship of Maecenas. He filled the office of a clerk

familiarity. ‘⁴ Dionysius has conveyed our little volume to me3
which, not to quarrel with its brevity, take in good part. But
you seem ιο me fearfifl, lest your works should be bigger than
ourself. However, what you want in height, is made up to you
by that little round body of years· You should, thereffire, write
such a roll, as may go, not round a stick‚ but a quart memte}
and then the circumference of your volume may be squab and
swollen, like the* roeunaity of yeur little bellqd’ This is apleasing
monal trait. Horace has, himself, given us some interesting

‘ ts ofhis person and manners· He was gray before his time3
fond ofbasking inthe sun3 and oftaking asimaon the bank of
a river. He speaks of breaking stones and turning up the ground,
when in the country3 and when in town, of saunteringin the mar-
ket, or riding out on a dock-tailed mule, which he sat awkwardly.
He dined on a pancake and vegetables; and divided the rest of
