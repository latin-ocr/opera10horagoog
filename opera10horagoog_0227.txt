ODE XXII.

Mt. Sanadon sayS, that Horace was at an entertainment where
a dispute began to inflame some of the company already heated
with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by grave ad-

vice and sober reasoning, he gayly proposed to drown all disputes
tul: a humper3 which having succeeded, 118 wrote a few lines on

e occasion.

The occasion of this 0118 18 1101 known, although it has been 1118
subject of various conjectures. It 18 a dialog-ue, represented 88
having taken place between a mariner 81111 1118 shade of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher os Tarentum.

Archytas had been shipwrecked on the 80881 of Ap ulia3 81111
1118 poet represents 8 1118111181, who had accidentally pfound 1118
body driven ashore by the waveS, as thus exclaiming: ‘And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How small a space you cover,
who could measure the 1188118118, 1118 881111, 81111 1118 seal’ 'Phe ad-
dress of the mariner occupies the first six verses3 and the reply
continues through the ode.

the wide extended ocean, and the land. But Dacier, Gesner, an
others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little

,8181188 18 made at ythe conclusion of the ode, where the mariner 18

entreated 10 18111181 11118 little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.
