ODE XVII.

It seems that Maecenas had intimated to Horace his intention of
making him a visit at his country-seat at Tibur, in the Sabine ter-
utar& adozztihvggdldg tor gt'ivxvrgnlliits {ildgslgliilo‘ffs 131⁶}an cdmvsselcome ιο his
house, but, to prevent any disappointment in one accustomed to the
choice wines and other luxuries of the court at Rome, he tells him
ne will find but plain fare.

1. Vile . . . Sabinum .· ‘ cheap Sabine wine-‚²

2. (ἔπεσά . . . plausu-9.- ‘which I sealed *in a Grecian jar the
very day on whlch you received such applause in the theatre?
—Testd .· the Romans, when most careful to preserve their wine,
and to correct its crudity, put it into earthen jarS, which were at
first imported from Greece.—Levi .· from lino ,- when the jars were
filled, they were sealed or closed up with pitch or wax. Although
the Sabine wine was by no means worthy osso much care and ex-
pense, yet, as on the occasion referred to, MaecenaS, on making
his appearance at the theatre for the first time after a severe ill-
ness, had be'en received with acclamations and shouts of joy, Ho-
race had preserved the date in this way3 and now pays a very
delicate compliment to his patron by alluding to that circum·
stance.

5.· Paterni uminis .· the Tiber flows stom Etruria, where the
ancestors of aecenas dwelt.

· 8. Imago .· “the echo.’

9. Proelo . . . Caleno .· ‘by a Calenian wine-press.' The best
presses were made at Cales. The sense seems to be this3 ‘You
wil] drink the choice Caecubian wine, at home if you please‚ or
where it is to be had3 but I have neither Falernian nor Formian
wine-‚² Some suppose this to be a hint for Maecenas to bring some
wine with him, better than was to be found at Tibur.

ODE XVIII.

This is a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to Apollo and Diana,
to be sung by a choir of twenty-seven young men, and another
choir of the same number of young virginS, on a day consecrated
to the worship of these tutelary divinities. The poet seems to
, ιαξο the part of a priest of Apollo, and to dictate to each choir
w at to sing.

· 1. Teneroe . . . virgines .· the choir of virgins is first exhorted to ,

sing the praises of Diana.. . ῃ ·
2. Ιπίοπειιτηὶ . . Cynthium .· then the choir of young men is ex-

. hortcd to sing the praises of Apollo·

3. Latonamque . . . Jovi .· ‘ Sing too Latona, the mother of both,
supremely loved by almighty J ove.’
