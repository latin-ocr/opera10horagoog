EPISTLE 11.

Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is addressed‚ was, at the
time it was written, absent with Tiberius-Nero. Horace gives
his reasons for not having complied with the request of Florus
that be would send him some lyric poems. He tells him that he
wished to devote himself to the study of philosophy. And
throughout the epistle he intersperses many excellent precepts
for the regulation of the conduct, and for securing a good and
happy life. He commences with a lively and amusing account
of a slave-dealer, as an example of the verbosity and knavery of
that class of men.
