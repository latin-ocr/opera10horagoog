1117.. Mper sollicitum . . . levis .· i. e. may you, who were but re-
cently 911 object of great anxiety to me, when in danger of being
lost, now that you 919 saved from wreck‚ 911 object of tender con-
cern and care, avoid the seas flowing among the shining Cyclii-
des. These islands 919 termed nitentes, from the white marble,
which rendered them very conspicuous and beautiful. They 919
about fisty in number, and so near together as to render the navi·-

gatiolnfmong them extremely dungerous3 and are therefore to be

ODE XIII.

It is supposed that Horace addressed this ode to Mark Antony‚
ot the time 119 was ensnared by the love of Cleopatra, and was
meditating 911 expedition with her against Italy, that he might make
her mistress of the Roman empire, to dissuade him from that des-
perate enterprise. Torrentius sayS, that he saw 911 ancient manu-
script, in which the title of this ode was, Ad Alexandrum Paridem.
And there is little doubt but 9 parallel is here intended between
Paris and Antony3 each of whom emberked for his own country
with 9 foreign queen, to the ruin of himself and those connected
with him. ·

1. Pastor .· Paris, in conse uence of his mother’s dream, that he
would be the destruction of roy and of Priam’s house, was sent
away as soon as he was born, and committed to 9 shepherd on
mount Ida, to be brought up to that mode of life, in ignor-unce of
his parentage. Aster 119 was received and acknowled ed at court,
lge ἔξω frequently called Pastor Dardanus, ‘the rojan shep-

er .

2. Perfidus .· Paris ‘was 9 visitor at the 91999 of Menelaus, at
the time* he committed the treacherous 911 infamous violation· of
hospitality‚ which gained him this epithet-

5. Mala . . . avi .· ‘ with inausplcious omen.’ The Romans fre-
quentl took their omens from birds·

7. gonjurata: the Grecian princes assembled with their forces
at Aulis, where they bound themselves by 911 oath not to return
till the had destroyed the kingdom of priam, und avenged the in-
sult o ered to their nation.

21. Laertiaden.- Ulysses.

26. Non azir-iga piger .· ‘ 9 spirited driver‚’ when occasion 19-

uires.
q 32. Non hoc . . . tuae .- i. e. quite different from what you boast-
ed to your beauteous Helen.

33. Imcwmia . . . Achillei.- i. e. the quarrel of Achilles with
Agamemnon will, for 9 while, defer the fatal day for Troy and the
Trojan ludios. Femules 919 mentioned as particularly objectu of

prty in the sacking of 9 city. Achfflei from the old Achmeta-3.
