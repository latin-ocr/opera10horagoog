ODE v11.

A festival was obser-ved with much religious pomp by the Ro-
man ladies on the first of March, in memory of the day on which
the Sabine women reconciled and made peace between the Sa-
1111108 and their husbandS, who had seized them. On this day, too,
they had dedicated a temple to Jun0‚ in which they annually of·
fered sacrifices ιο that goddess, While the ladies were engaged ¹
in their offer-inge to Iuno, their husbands sacrificed to J anus, Af-
ter these religious services were over, the ladies received pres·
ents from their husbande and other {ri-ends, as an acknowledg-
ment of the favor conferred by their happy mediation. The Ca-
1011118 of March were called Matronalia, or Matronales Fertae.
