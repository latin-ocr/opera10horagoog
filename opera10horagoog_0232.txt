ODE XXX.

Plotius Numida had been three years with AugustuS, engaged
in a war in Spain. On his return, he was received with ‹lemon-
smfions of Joy and thanksgiving by his friend Horace, who, on
this happy occasion, assembled the friends of Plotius, and among
them AElius Lamia, a school· fellow of Plotius, and dearly beloved
gy him. This celebration was attended with sacrifices, songs, and

ances.

2. Placare: ‘to propitiate.’ This word may with propriety be
used, although Plotius had returned in safety 3 since his friends
were still bound ιο the performance of their vows3 and would have
{cason ιο fear the resentment of the gods if this should be neg-
ected.

5. Multa.- sc. dividit oscula.

8. Non alio rege.- it was customary among the Romans to call
the tutor or governor of a nobleman’ s children rex, or king. Plotius
and Lamia had not only passed their boyhood together under the
same tutor, but had assumed the manly gown, ⁹toga virilis, at the
same time..

9. Matutae.- i. e. the toga praetexta, which was bordered with
purple, was laid aside for the toga virilis, which was of pure white,
and assumed at the age of seventeen years. This change of the
toga was attended with some solemnity, and usually before the
images of the Lares,

10. Gressd: fortunate and happy days were marked with chnut,
or a white stone· , and unlucky days with a black mark, or a black
stone. These were added up at the end of the year.

12. Morem m Salium.- for Saliomm; ‘aster the manner of the
Salii? These were the twelve priests of Mars. See Lempriere.
h 131. Παιέιαῑίοε this was a woman of light character, notorious for

er ove o wine.

dnlnlr Bassum.- Bassus was a companion of Plotius, and a hard
er.

ODE XXXI.

The death of Cleopatra put an end to the war between Augus
tus and Antony. This is one of several odes which Horace wrote
on that occasion. The character and tragical end of Cleopatra
are strikingly represented. Her passions are in violent motion· ,
her ambition is intoxication; her love is madness3 and her cour-

Ege· is despair. The soul of the poet seems kindled with unusual
re

2. δολίων-ὦτοι. ..·ἆαρῶω The feasts of the Salii were of the
most splendid and ‘costly kind. The poet here probably means ιο
say that it is pro er to prepare a lectisternium3 which was a feast
at which the g were invited to attend, and for whom couches
