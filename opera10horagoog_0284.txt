Horace exhorta his friends to seize every occasion of enjoying
life while it is in their power to do so, and especially to pass with

EPODE XI.

The civil war between Caesar and Pompey had been succeeded
by that between Octavius and Brutus; and when these commo-
tione had come to an end, others arose between OctaviuS, then
called Au ustae, and Antony. The Roman empire was divided
between ese chiese, and the Adriatic was covered with their
fleets. A‘battle was expected, which was to decide the fate of
the empire. On the eve of this dreadful scene, Horace composed
this epode‚ in which he deplores the condition of the Roman peo-
ἔξω, and intimates that they may as well abandon their country

r ever, as live amidst such soenes of horror and uncertainty. In
short, the civil wars, which began between Marius and Sylla m

the year 666 of Rome, were never perfectly extinguished fin the
death of Antony in 724.
