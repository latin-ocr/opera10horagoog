SATIRE 111.

This satire, written by way of dialogus, is intended ιο show that
all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had retired in-
to the country during the Saturnalia. Damasippus, a stoic phi-
losopher, pays him a visit, and in conversation blames him for not
writing and publishing something neW, instead of remaining idle,
or retouching his former works. The discourse, by an easy tran-
sition‚ turns upon Damasippus and his modo of life. This leads
