The shortness of life and the inevitable event of death are very
feelingly set forth in this ode. But the argument and the infer-
ence are, as usual with our poet, employed to enforce the doctrine
of a refined Epicureanism. Had the light of revelation been shed
on his mind, he would not only have considered the shortness of
life as a reason for enjoying it as it passed, which is indeed
philosophy3 but he would also have urged the necessity of fonn-

the character for a higher and a nobler existence.
m{Who the person was, that is here addressed by the name of
Posthumus, or Postumus, as some say it should be written, has
not been ascertained. But it appears to have been a friend
whom Horace considered too parsimonious, and advises to a more
liberal enjoyment of his fortune.

In this ode Horace contrasts the magnificence of the Romans

of his time, in their buildings, plantations, gardens, and pleasure ·

grounds, with the frugality of their ancestors3 who considered the
public edifices, and the temples of the goda, the noblest monu-
ments of real grandem, as well as of piety.
