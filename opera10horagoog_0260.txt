of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5th of December.
Both these days were observed by sacrifices and festivity in hon-
or of Faunae, who was supposed ιο preside over their flocks and
fields.' This ode was probably written for one of his festivals.
In the first part, the poet entreats Fanum, if he pays him due hon-
ore, to smile upon his fields, and preserve the tender offspring of
his flocks3 and in the second, he sets forth the joy of the village
on the return of his autumna] feast, when man and beast will re-
lax from their toil, and rejoice in the bounty of their benefactor.

of his friends had met together in honor of the occasion 3 and that
among them were Horace, and another poet named Telephus, who
was a great scholar, and who undertook to entertain the company
with some grave discussion on ancient history. Horace interrupte
him by intimating that it were better to inquire where the best
wine was to be had, with the requisites for an entertainment, that
&ey ωἰῆῐιι drink their friend’s health in honor of his new appoint-
