EPISTLE XV.

cold bath to Horace, who practised cold bathing in Clusium and
Gabii. But finding the winter too severe, he resolved to go to
some warmer climate, and' try sea-bathing. For this reason, he
writes to his friend Numonius Vela, who had been us' the baths
at Velia and Salernum, to give him some account of e climate,
