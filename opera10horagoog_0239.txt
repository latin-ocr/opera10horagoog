ODE VH.

Licinius Varro Murena, the brother of Proculeius Varro Mure-
na, mentioned m Ode Π. 5. of this Book, for his parental affection
and generosity towards his brothers, was a young man of a restless,
ardent, and ambitious spirit. Horace, knowing his character, and -
wishing to preserve him from the evils to which his fearless and -
aspiring views exposed him, addressed this ode to him, 001113111-

of consolation which he frequently gives to others m trouble. He
exhorts them not to be anxious about futurity3 since life is too
short to have any portion of 11 wasted m unavailing 3331311330Ιᾶ
