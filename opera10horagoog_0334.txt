EPISTLE XII.

This e istle is addressed to the same person to whom Horace
addresse the xxlvth Ode of the first Book. He there rallies
Iccius with some humor on turning soldier, and abandoning his
literary and philosophioal pursuits. He now ridiculas his love of

EPIsTLE xm.
It seems our poet had intrusted several rolls of his writings,
