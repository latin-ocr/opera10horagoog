ΤΟ THE METRES USED BY HORACE.
—-4·—

Romen uses twenty different kinds of Measure, or varie-
ties of Metre. 'These are combined in sixteen different ways,
forming, of course, sizteen different Strophes, or Stanzas.* In
order to know to which of these combinationsany ode be-
longs, we have only to find the first words of that ode in the
following Alphabetical Index ; and against them is placed the
number of the combination to which it belongs, and according
to which it may be scanned. For instance3 suppose it were
desired to know the kind of verse contained in the First Ode
of the First Book 3 look in the Alphabetical Index on the next
page, and find there the first worda, Maecenas atavis ,· and
against them stands VII.. No. VII, then, of the Combinations
on page 198, informs you that the verse is Asclepiadeam and
shows you how it may be scanned. In the same way the
method of scanning every ode in Horace may be known, by
finding the first words of it in the Index, and referring to the
number against it, in the Combinations. ’

*A strophe, or stanza, includes as many lines as are necessary to
show all the different kinds of measure in an ode. 1t is called strophe,
which, in Greek, literally means a turni-ng, because, at the end orit, you
turn back to the same kind of verse with which you began.
