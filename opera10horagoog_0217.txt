14. mium . . . Thetidis .· Achilles: Thetis, the mother of
Achilles, was warned by an oracle‚ that, if he went to the siege of
l 'l'roy with the other Grecian princeS‚ he would be slain there. 'l'o
prevent‘ him from going, she'caused him to be clad in female at·
tire, and sent to the court of Lycomedes, that he might pass for
one of his daughters, and escape discovery. But as another pra-
cle had declared·that Troy could never be taken without Achilles,
Ulysses was sent in quest of him, and had the art to discover him
by placing among some female ornaments exhibited before the
daughters of Lycomedes a splendid sword, which was instantly
seized by Achilles.

ODE VIII.

It would seem, from the tenor of this ode, that something had
happened to disturb and depress the mind of Thaliarchus 3 and
that Horace, to enliven his friend, addressed this ode to him. ·

It is highly colored with our poet’s Epicurean principleS, and
it enforces his favorite doctrine, that man should not trouble
himself about futurity, and that all he has to do is to make the most
of present enjoyments‚ and ιο leave the rest to the gods.

Some have supposed Thaliarchus ιο be a fictitious name3 and
that the whole is an imitation of an ode of Alcaeus.

1. Alta statuive candidum Soracte .· Soracte, now vulgarly called
Sant Oreste, a corruption of its modern name, Samo deoetro, is a
high mountain of Etruria. It is of a conical form, situated on a
plain, and wholly detached from the range of the Apennines, which
passes near it. The Tiber sweeps by its base. This mountain,
though thirty miles from Rome, is distinctly seen from that city,
and it forms avery picturesque object in the distance. During the
winter of 1829—30‚ I observed that the Apennines were white with
snow at times when Soracte was free from it. May not the circum-
stance of this mountain being covered with deepsnow be a‘lluded
to by our poet to imply that the winter was unusually severe Ρ

8. Βίοἰά .· this was an earthen vessel‚ containing about nine
gallons, with two ears, or handles, by which it was carried—Sabi-
πάι i. e. in which Sabine wine has been put.

18. Campus, et areae .· i. e. the Campus Martius, and other open
places, as courts and squares, in which the young of both sexes

met at these scenes of youthful recreation.
