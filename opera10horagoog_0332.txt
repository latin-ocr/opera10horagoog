EPISTLE VIII.

This epistle is addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, the secretary
of Tiberius, who is mentioned Book Ι. Ep. III. 15. Horace de-
scribes himself as laboring under hypochondriac affectione, incon-
stant, contradictory, and unreasonable.

1. Celso . . . Neronis .- the construction is, Ο Musa rogata, refer

14. Ut laceat ‘uvenit ‘how he stands with the youthful
prince‚’ '1⁸1 erius laudius Nera—Gohorti .· ‘to the courtiers,’
about the prince.

17. Ut tu . . ‚sev-emus.- the poet bids the muse to remind his
friend Celsus, that their future intimae will depend upon him-
self: if in his high station he does not orget his old friend, nei-
ther will that friend forget him: ‘ as thou bearest thy high for·
tune, Celsus, so will we conduct ourselves towards thee?

EPISTLE IX.

This is a letter of introduction and commendation to Tiberius
Claudius Nero in behalf of Septimiae, the poet's particular friend.
The great delicacy necessary on such an occasion is manifestly
felt by Horace, who pleads the importunity of his friend, as an
excuse for what he-doeS, with modesty and seeming reluctance.

1. Se timius . . ,facias .· ⁴ O ClaudiuS‚ Septimius alone, forsooth,
knows ow high Ι stand in your esteem.' ⁸

6. Quid . . . i εο .· ‘he sees and understands how much influ-
ence I have wi you much better than I do myself!

10. Sic ego . . . proemia .- ⁴ so I, to avoid the appearance of a
greater crime (unwillingness to serve a friend), have taken upon
myselfa little modest asem-auce! Descendi expresses his unwill-
ingness‚ and that he did not at first intend to do it.

EPISTLE X.

There are few rsons insensible to the pleasures of the coun-
try. In Horace e love of rural retirement became a kind of
